## Problem Description

Given **head**, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the **next** pointer. Internally, **pos** is used to denote the index of the node that tail's **next** pointer is connected to. **Note that *pos* is not passed as a parameter.**
<br><br>
Return **true** <i>if there is a cycle in the linked list.</i> Otherwise, return **false**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 

**Output:** true  

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
<br>
<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0  

**Output:** true  

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
<br>
<br>

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1  

**Output:** false   

**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Code

- C++ Code:(**"Two Pointers Approach"**)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        
        if(head == NULL)
        {
            return false;
        }
        
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;
        
        while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL)
        {
            slow = slow->next;
            
            fast = fast->next->next;
            
            if(fast == slow)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
