## Problem Description

You are given the **head** of a linked list. **Delete** the **middle node**, and return *the **head** of the modified linked list*.

The **middle node** of a linked list of size **n** is the **⌊n / 2⌋th** node from the **start** using **0-based indexing**, where **⌊x⌋** denotes the largest integer less than or equal to **x**.  
◾ For **n** = **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and **5**, the middle nodes are **0**, **1**, **1**, **2**, and **2**, respectively.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]  

**Output:** [1,3,4,1,2,6]  

**Explanation:**  
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.  
We return the new list after removing this node.
<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4]  

**Output:** [1,2,4]  

**Explanation:**  
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
<br>

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [2,1]  

**Output:** [2]  

**Explanation:**  
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.  
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.

## Code

- C++ Code:(**"Two Pointers Approach"**)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {

        if(head->next == NULL)
        {
            return NULL;
        }

        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *prevNode = NULL;

        while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL)
        {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            prevNode = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        prevNode->next = slow->next;

        delete slow;

        return head;
    }
};
```
