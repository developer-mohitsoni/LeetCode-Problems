## Problem Description

Given the **head** of a linked list, return <i>the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return **null.**</i>

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the **next** pointer. Internally, **pos** is used to denote the index of the node that tail's **next** pointer is connected to **(0-indexed).** It is **-1** if there is no cycle. **Note that <i>pos</i> is not passed as a parameter.**

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1  

**Output:** tail connects to node index 1  

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.  
<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0  

**Output:** tail connects to node index 0  

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.  
<br>

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1  

**Output:** no cycle  

**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Code

- C++ Code:(**"Two Pointers Approach"**)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {

        ListNode *fast = head;

        ListNode *slow = head;

        while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL)
        {
            slow = slow->next;
            
            fast = fast->next->next;

            if(slow == fast)
            break;
        }
        if(slow == NULL || fast == NULL || fast->next == NULL)
        return NULL;

        ListNode *start = head, *from_meet = fast;

        while(start != from_meet)
        {
            start = start->next;

            from_meet = from_meet->next;
        }
        return start;
    }
};
```
